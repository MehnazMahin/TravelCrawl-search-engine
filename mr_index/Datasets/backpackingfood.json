[{"title": "8 days of vegan backpacking food for a couple", "body": "My girlfriend and I are leaving on an 8 day hiking trip. We will be hiking in Chile, Siete tazas. We have experience in trips of that size but this is our first vegan one! It was pretty challenging because we are not in our home country, and only had one day to prep. \n\nThings we considered:\n\n-nutritional value\n\n-weight\n\n-prize\n\n-Volume\n\n-taste\n\n-...\n\nThis is what we came up with:\n\nBreakfast:\n\nOats with dried mango, raisins, peanuts, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds. Coffee and cocoa powder.\n\nI like my oats without de chocolat, she does. Pretty happy about breakfast. We could have changed chia for flaxseeds or added vegan milk powder. \n\nLunch:\n\nWraps/crackers with peanut butter, mermelade, condensed soya milk, dehydrated tomatoes and/or toasted onion. Crisps.\n\nWe usually eat crackers one day and next one wraps. \n\nDinner:\n\n-Rice noodles with, vegetable stock powder, dried mushroom, toasted onion and spices (garlic, onion, mixed spice)\n\n- mashed potato with nutritional yeast, and a pack of quinoa-mushroom soup. \n\n-pre made couscous mediterian style with extra dehydrated tomatoes and onion. \n\n-whole grain pasta, dehydrated tomatoe soup as sauce with dried vegetable protein .\n\n-noodles with vegetable stock, plant protein, dehydrated tomatoes.\n\n-mashed potatoe with plant protein, nutrition yeast and dehydrated mushroom\n\n-Whole grain pasta with vegetable soup/sauce, dehydrated tomatoes, onion\n\n-pre made couscous tomatoe style with what's leftover \n\n- olive oil for extra calories and taste\n\nSnacks:\n\n-Vegan bars\n\n-diy roasted nut mix of: pumpkin seeds, peanuts, walnuts\n\n-coockies\n\n-dried fruit: mango, raisin\n\nSweet and salty\n\nSeems like a pretty good variety of things could definitely be:\n\nHealthier\n\nCheaper\n\nLighter\n\nBut we're pretty happy with what we came up with for the circumstances.\n\nThe pasta needs to boil longest time with 9 minutes. What do you guys think?! Will we be hungry and protein deficient? \ud83d\ude02\n\nWe don't have a scale here to weigh all the food. Unfortunately.\n\nWe'll let you know how it was!\n\nEdit: here is a picture of the food: [foood](http://imgur.com/gallery/cubd1AI) \nadded olive oil and crisps, since I forgot", "id": "ec4tmr", "image": "https://www.reddit.com/r/backpackingfood/comments/ec4tmr/8_days_of_vegan_backpacking_food_for_a_couple/", "num_comments": 3, "link": "/r/backpackingfood/comments/ec4tmr/8_days_of_vegan_backpacking_food_for_a_couple/", "upvotes": 8, "comments": ["Definitely weight could be an issue.
